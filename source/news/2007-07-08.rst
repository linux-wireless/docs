Linux 2.6.22, released today, features the initial inclusion of `mac80211 <en/developers/mac80211>`__, the upcoming unified Linux wireless stack which will be shared between a number of drivers. No drivers in this kernel release use mac80211, but existing drivers will be ported and new drivers will be added later.

Alongside the usual rounds of driver updates and fixes, the Marvell Libertas 8388 USB-wireless driver was added, which drives the hardware in the `OLPC laptop <http://www.laptop.org>`__.
