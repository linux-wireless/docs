`Linux 2.6.26 <http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_26>`__ is released. With almost 600 changesets related to wireless, this release brings you lots more wireless goodies:

-  mac80211 now supports draft mesh networking (802.11s; thanks to the `open80211s project <http://www.open80211s.org/>`__)
-  :doc:`zd1211rw <../en/users/drivers/zd1211rw>` supports mesh networking (:doc:`b43 <../en/users/drivers/b43>` will follow in 2.6.27, hopefully more drivers later)
-  mac80211 now supports more optional HT (802.11n) features
-  mac80211's monitor interfaces can now be configured more precisely, "cooked" monitors were added
-  mac80211's IBSS implementation now supports IBSS merging and received various bugfixes
-  mac80211 now has an in-kernel :doc:`documentation book <../mac80211book>`, help welcome!
-  :doc:`b43 <../en/users/drivers/b43>` now has support for PCMCIA devices and QoS/WME

Also, lots of removals this time:

::

     * the bcm43xx driver 
     * the old ieee80211softmac code Access point mode has received a lot of attention in the stack and drivers, but is not ready yet. 

Finally, lots of internal API updates and fixes.
