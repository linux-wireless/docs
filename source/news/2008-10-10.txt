[[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_27|Linux 2.6.27]] is out. Our patch rate is increasing, there were about 700 patches in wireless code. The feature rate seems to be slightly decreasing, entirely new features are: 
  * [[en/users/Drivers/ath9k|the ath9k driver]] 
  * Intel wireless 5000 series support 
  * some RTL8187B support 
  * mac80211_hwsim - virtual 802.11 hardware 
  * some of the rt2x00 drivers can do hardware crypto now 
  * [[en/Drivers/b43|b43]] got mesh networking support 

Important internal improvements were made: 
    * mac80211 is entirely multi-queue aware now, with the new multi-queue netdev features 
    * mac80211 now requires many fewer kmalloc calls -- control information was moved to skb->cb 
    * mac80211 now creates correct QoS sequence numbers Unfortunately, as of now, aggregation had to be disabled due needing more than just fixups after the multiqueue work.
