`Linux 2.6.27 <http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_27>`__ is out. Our patch rate is increasing, there were about 700 patches in wireless code. The feature rate seems to be slightly decreasing, entirely new features are:

-  :doc:`the ath9k driver <../en/users/drivers/ath9k>`
-  Intel wireless 5000 series support
-  some RTL8187B support
-  mac80211_hwsim - virtual 802.11 hardware
-  some of the rt2x00 drivers can do hardware crypto now
-  `b43 <en/Drivers/b43>`__ got mesh networking support

Important internal improvements were made:

::

     * mac80211 is entirely multi-queue aware now, with the new multi-queue netdev features 
     * mac80211 now requires many fewer kmalloc calls -- control information was moved to skb->cb 
     * mac80211 now creates correct QoS sequence numbers Unfortunately, as of now, aggregation had to be disabled due needing more than just fixups after the multiqueue work.
