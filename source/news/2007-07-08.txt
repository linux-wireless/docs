Linux 2.6.22, released today, features the initial inclusion of [[en/developers/mac80211|mac80211]], the upcoming unified Linux wireless stack which will be shared between a number of drivers.

Alongside the usual rounds of driver updates and fixes, the Marvell Libertas 8388 USB-wireless driver was added, which drives the hardware in the [[http://www.laptop.org|OLPC laptop]].
