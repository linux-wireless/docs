The `2.6.28 <http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_28>`__ kernel is released. About 400 patches related to wireless have been merged and once again this release brings a slew of new wireless features to the kernel:

-  :doc:`regulatory support <../en/developers/regulatory>` -- the kernel will now attempt to obey local wireless spectrum regulations
-  :doc:`libertas_tf <../en/users/drivers/libertastf>` -- a thin firmware driver for the XO-1's wireless
-  :doc:`ath5k <../en/users/drivers/ath5k>` gains mesh networking
-  the full-mac :doc:`orinoco <../en/users/drivers/orinoco>` driver gains WPA support
-  :doc:`p54 <../en/users/drivers/p54>` gains 5 GHz support
-  mac80211 got mesh portal functionality (bridging a mesh mode interface)
-  the :doc:`minstrel <../en/developers/documentation/mac80211/ratecontrol/minstrel>` rate control algorithm was added along with rate control API improvements
-  nl80211 userspace API improvements for various things As usual, some drivers and mac80211 received cleanups and API changes:

   -  Some mac80211 driver operations are no longer required to be atomic which makes drivers simpler
   -  mac80211 code was restructured to be easier to read
   -  more station information is shared with the driver
   -  the rate control API was rewritten and made available to outside mac80211 (due to be updated again in 2.6.29 for better HT control etc.)
