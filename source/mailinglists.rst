Linux Wireless Mailing Lists
============================

We use two lists, linux-wireless and netdev. Use linux-wireless for
generic wireless development discussions. Always CC netdev for review of
upstream patches including for wireless-dev. A subscription is not
required to write to these lists.

- Wireless specific development: linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org
- Linux network development: netdev@vger.kernel.org
