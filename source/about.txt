===== How to use this wiki =====

If you want to edit this site, make sure to create a user and log in. If you need to be able to delete pages or similar, ask someone who is listed on [[AdminGroup|AdminGroup]] to add you there. 

The navigation for this site is completely generated from the wiki contents itself. 

The three categories can be changed on [[en/sitemap|en/sitemap]], if a browser has a different language and the page <code>LANG-CODE</code>/sitemap exists it will be used instead. This can be used to translate the navigation. 

In order to add items to the categories edit for example [[en/users/navi|en/users/navi]]. 

Please make sure to add new material as sub-pages so that the correct category is shown.
