How to use this wiki
--------------------

If you want to edit this site, make sure to create a user and log in. If you need to be able to delete pages or similar, ask someone who is listed on :doc:`AdminGroup <admingroup>` to add you there.

The navigation for this site is completely generated from the wiki contents itself.

The three categories can be changed on :doc:`en/sitemap <en/sitemap>`, if a browser has a different language and the page ``LANG-CODE``/sitemap exists it will be used instead. This can be used to translate the navigation.

In order to add items to the categories edit for example :doc:`en/users/navi <en/users/navi>`.

Please make sure to add new material as sub-pages so that the correct category is shown.
