We have worked with different wireless device vendors to address their
concerns for FOSS driver development. The biggest barrier with vendor
support has been legal considerations due to regulatory compliance. The
document below summarizes the approach we have taken on successfully
enhancing vendor support.

If you are a wireless vendor, want a driver for Linux, and do not have
the resources to do it we have good news for you -- we will write it for
you and support it for free! See bellow for more details

In July 2007, the `Software Freedom Law Center
<http://www.softwarefreedom.org>`__ released a white paper describing
the implications of Software Defined Radio (SDR) FCC classifications on
open source drivers. This may be useful to vendors with regulatory
concerns.
