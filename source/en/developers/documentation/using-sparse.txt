===== Using sparse =====

Sparse is a semantic parser and static analyzer utility we use for Linux kernel development. We highly recommend using sparse for the wireless subsystem. Below are some quick instructions how to get this set up and how to use it. 

 


===== Get sparse =====

You can get sparse from: 


<code>git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/sparse/sparse.git</code>

===== Version of sparse to use =====

We recommend to use the latest stable release of sparse. As of now this is v0.5.1, so you can do something as follows: 

<code>git checkout v0.5.1</code>

Or do <code>git tag -l</code> to see all releases.
===== Install sparse =====

To install: 


<code>make
make install</code>

===== Using sparse =====

To use sparse for kernel development simply pass on the C=1 argument onto your make command. For example to enable sparse for mac80211 development you would use: 


<code>make C=1 M=net/mac80211/</code>

===== Endian checks =====

Most endian complaints are typically valid and reflect design issues. These should be reviewed carefully. Happily, since v4.10-rc1 these checks are automatically enabled.
