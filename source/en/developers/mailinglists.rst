About the Linux wireless mailing lists
======================================

The *linux-wireless* was introduced in February of 2007 due to the fact
that it was difficult to keep track of wireless-specific only related
e-mails on *netdev*. We now use *linux-wireless* for **all** wireless
development discussions, including to post patches. We now **only** post
to *netdev* if patches or suggested changes touch generic networking
code. If you are interested in sending patches please read our
:doc:`Submitting Patches <documentation/submittingpatches>` guide.
