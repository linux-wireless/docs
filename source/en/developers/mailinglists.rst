About the Linux wireless mailing list
-------------------------------------

The *linux-wireless* was introduced in February of 2007 due to the fact that it was difficult to keep track of wireless-specific only related e-mails on *netdev*. We now use *linux-wireless* for **all** wireless development discussions, including to post patches. We now **only** post to *netdev* if patches or suggested changes touch generic networking code. If you are interested in sending patches please read our :doc:`Submitting Patches <documentation/submittingpatches>` guide.
