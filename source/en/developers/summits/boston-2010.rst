Boston 2010
===========

**CANCELLED / POSTPONED (was August 8-9)**

The original `LinuxCon <LinuxCon>`__-hosted event has been cancelled due to the fact that the peer-to-peer specification will not have been released at that time. We are seeking venues for a replacement event later in the year, probably still in the Boston area. Watch this space for updates!

The original info is preserved below just in case it is helpful to someone...
