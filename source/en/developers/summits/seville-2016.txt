As the previous year, this event is going to be a workshop at the [[http://www.netdevconf.org/1.1/|netdev 1.1 conference]]. As a consequence, you need to be registered for that conference to attend.

The workshop is going to take place on the second day of netdev 1.1, February 11th.


Suggested Topics

  * Android wifi topics (Dmitry, ~45mins)
  * NaN APIs
  * FTM APIs
  * firmware debugging with triggers in iwlwifi (Emmanuel)
  * 802.3 frame format support in mac80211 (Kalle)
  * per-station netdev queues
  * latency under load reduction - time estimation vs. stations vs. queues
  * RSS on wireless, in particular mac80211 (Johannes)
    * RX statistics (wild idea: bpf? though that assumes a single userspace controller?)
    * RX optimisation/fastpath?
  * OpenWrt code out of upstream (http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git , target/linux/* and package/kernel/*)
  * regulatory - simplification? (Johannes)
  * "roaming" offload with auth/assoc - candidate reporting (Johannes/Ilan)
  * FILS secured association (Jouni/Johannes)
  * beacon report scan (Johannes)
  * MU-MIMO sniffer
  * Johannes's EL
  * next workshop with LPC/KS in November (Santa Fe)?
