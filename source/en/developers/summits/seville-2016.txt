As the previous year, this event is going to be a workshop at the [[http://www.netdevconf.org/1.1/|netdev 1.1 conference]]. As a consequence, you need to be registered for that conference to attend.

The workshop is going to take place on the second day of netdev 1.1, February 11th.

  * per-station netdev queues
  * latency under load reduction - time estimation vs. stations vs. queues
  * RSS on wireless, in particular mac80211 (Johannes)
    * RX statistics (wild idea: bpf? though that assumes a single userspace controller?)
