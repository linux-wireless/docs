==== drivers needing full conversion ====
  * airo 
  * atmel 
  * ipw2x00 (some trivial work done) 
  * prism54 - as much as we'd like to kill it, it still the only option for some users of some specific FullMAC cards where p54pci does not work 
  * ray ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11_%28legacy_mode%29|802.11-legacy mode]]) 
  * wl3501 ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11_%28legacy_mode%29|802.11-legacy mode]]) 
  * zd1201 (some of these are for ancient hardware that likely nobody cares about any more, not converting them might mean that future userspace breaks but that doesn't seem problematic) 


==== drivers that have partial conversion ====
    * orinoco 
    * libertas 
==== drivers to kill ====
      * hostap (?) From this list, only ipw2200 and libertas are 802.11**g** hardware. All others are only 802.11**b**, except ray and wl3501.
