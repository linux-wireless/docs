Open firmware for ath9k_htc
---------------------------

The :doc:`ath9k_htc <../../../users/drivers/ath9k_htc>` driver is upstream on the Linux kernel and supports QCA's newest USB 802.11n devices. We have open firmware for :doc:`carl9170 <../../../users/drivers/carl9170>` through :doc:`carl9170.fw <../../../users/drivers/carl9170.fw>` but ath9k_htc has no open firmware yet. One possible project is for a student to work on open firmware for ath9k_htc.

Requirements
------------

::

     * Embedded Linux experience 
     * Programming in C 
     * Some Linux kernel driver development experience 

How this would work
-------------------

You can get code under NDA through QCA once its ready for public consumption you can post it under a GPL Compatible license.

Mentors available
