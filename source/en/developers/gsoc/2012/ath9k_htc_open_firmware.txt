===== Open firmware for ath9k_htc =====

The [[en/users/Drivers/ath9k_htc|ath9k_htc]] driver is upstream on the Linux kernel and supports QCA's newest USB 802.11n devices. We have open firmware for [[en/users/Drivers/carl9170|carl9170]] through [[en/users/Drivers/carl9170.fw|carl9170.fw]] but ath9k_htc has no open firmware yet. One possible project is for a student to work on open firmware for ath9k_htc. 


===== Requirements =====
    * Embedded Linux experience 
    * Programming in C 
    * Some Linux kernel driver development experience 
===== How this would work =====

You can get code under NDA through QCA once its ready for public consumption you can post it under a GPL Compatible license. 


===== Mentors available =====
