===== Linux wireless GSoC 2010 =====

This is our second year with Linux wireless GSoC projects, under the [[https://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/gsoc/google-summer-code-2010|Linux Foundation GSoC umbrella]]. This is the home page to keep track of the current projects, their status development done through it. Students should also use these pages to keep track of their own status of their projects.

There are two projects for 2010 for 802.11 for GSoC:
