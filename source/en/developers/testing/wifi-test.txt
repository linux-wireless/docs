===== Wifi test 1.0 =====

[[http://intellinuxwireless.org/testing/Download/wifi-test-1.0.tar.gz|wifi-test 1.0]] covers following wireless features: 
  * BSS: BSS association, fragmentation/RTS/CTS, BSS channels etc 
  * IBSS: IBSS association, IBSS fragmentation/RTS/CTS, IBSS channels. 
  * Security: WEP (BSS/IBSS), WPA/WPA2, 802.1X. 
  * Power management: S3/S4, RFKILL 
  * Performance: upload/download speed for different combinations. 
  * Others: Wext mode, nl80211 mode 
  * 802.11 a/b/g/n: Above features in a/b/g/n band.  
===== Testing environment setup =====

The minimum testing system requirements are listed below. 
    * Two test machines: One as test machine, the other as peer machine in IBSS network testing. If only BSS is tested, one test machine is enough. 
    * One server machine: The server machine needs two Ethernet cards, one connects to the Test machine network and the other to the AP network. 
    * One AP: Support Cisco AP, Dlink and ASUS AP with CLI (Command Line Interface). For example, Dlink DWL-8200 AP and Cisco1200 series AP.  Here is an example of our test environment:
