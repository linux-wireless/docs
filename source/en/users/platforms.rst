Wireless router platforms
-------------------------

A lot of wireless access points ship on specific custom vendor platforms. This is done to simplify the units and communication. These are also known as `System on Chip (SoC) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System-on-a-chip>`__ solutions.

The following platforms are being worked on by the `OpenWrt <http://openwrt.org>`__ development project and the current platform codes are available in the `OpenWrt SVN repository <https://dev.openwrt.org>`__ until they mature enough for upstream inclusion.
