===== ath10k firmware =====

The ath10k firmware images are available from [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/|linux-firmware.git]] which all common Linux distributions should install by default. Latest firmware images can be downloaded from [[https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/ath-firmware/ath10k-firmware|ath10k-firmware.git]] from which they get eventually pushed to [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/|linux-firmware.git]].

* Note: It is possible to use newer ath10k driver on an older kernel with [[en/users/Drivers/ath10k/backports|backports project]].

===== Update firmware =====

First download the firmware image from the links above. In this example we use firmware-2.bin_10.1.467.2-1 from QCA988X 10.1 directory. Then just copy that file as firmware-2.bin to the ath10k firmware directory: 

<code>cp firmware-2.bin_10.1.467.2-1 /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA988X/hw2.0/firmware-2.bin</code>
Then reload ath10k (or restart the system) and you can [[en/users/Drivers/ath10k/debug#firmware_version|check if the new firmware is in use]]. 

Note: In some distributions the firmware location can be different than /lib/firmware. 

===== Firmware API versions =====

Because firmware changes between versions we have introduced firmware API concept to ath10k. This makes it possible to support different versions of ath10k. 


==== Firmware API 1 ====

The first version. Firmware images are in separate files: firmware.bin and otp.bin. There's no FW IE support. Deprecated since March 2014 and removed on March 2016.


==== Firmware API 2 ====

Embedding both firmware and otp images into same file firmware-2.bin. Firmware meta data provided through FW IE. Added in commit 1a222435a dated Sep 27 2013, for Linux 3.13. Deprecated, no new firmware releases use this anymore.

==== Firmware API 3 ====

Adding support for 10.2 firmware for QCA988X and ATH10K_FW_FEATURE_WMI_10_2 feature for 10.2 WMI mappings. Added in commit 24c88f7807fb7 dated Jul 27 2014. Deprecated, no new firmware releases use this anymore.

==== Firmware API 4 ====

Adding support for ATH10K_FW_IE_WMI_OP_VERSION. Added in commit 4a16fbec1cd0a dated December 17th 2014.

==== Firmware API 5 ====

Adding support for ATH10K_FW_IE_HTT_OP_VERSION, needed to support 10.2.4.48-2 on QCA988X. Added in commit 53513c302f35e March 25 2015.

==== Firmware API 6 ====

Workaround for board id being zero on QCA6174 hw3.0 starting from firmware release WLAN.RM.4.4-00022-QCARMSWPZ-2. Added in commit aad1fd7f7677 April 19 2017, first release v4.12-rc1.

Also for QCA9377 hw1.0 fix IRAM bank compatibility starting from firmware release WLAN.TF.2.1-00014-QCARMSWP-1. Added in commit fc8b92635f79 February 2018, first release v4.17-rc1.
