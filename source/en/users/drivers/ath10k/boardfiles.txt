===== Submitting board files =====

If you want to submit board files to the official board-2.bin file send a mail to [[ath10k@lists.infradead.org]] with this information:

  * use prefix "ath10k-firmware:" in the subject
  * description for what hardware this is
  * origin of the board file (did you create it yourself or where you downloaded)
  * ids to be used with the board file (ATH10K_BD_IE_BOARD_NAME in ath10k)
  * attach the actual board file (board.bin)

Note: You should NOT submit the full board-2.bin file, just the board file/image you want to add (ie. board.bin in ath10k terms).

If everything is ok Kalle will then add the file to the official board-2.bin. As it's easy to make a mistake when adding a new board image, and every character makes a difference, please always check the commited board file carefully.

Few good examples to follow:
