===== ath10k private support =====

Most likely you have contacted developers privately and was referenced to this page. Please avoid contacting developers privately and instead have all the discussions in public mailing lists. That way you and everyone else get the best support. See [[en/users/Drivers/ath10k/support|the ath10k support]] for details how to send to the list. 


Some of the reason why it's best to have public discussions on mailing lists: 
  * Developers are busy, they don't have time to help each user individually. In mailing lists developers can share the support load and have more time for development (which is really important).
  * Mistakes are usually fixed by others.
  * Mailing list discussions are archived so other users can easily find the solution using Google.
  * The whole team can then participate the discussion.
  * Normally you get better answers via mailing lists as more people can answer.

have time to give private support. Instead please check
