===== Submitting patches =====

Send patches to the mailing lists below. Kalle Valo reviews the patches within the next few days and, if they are ok, commits them to ath.git. 
      * To: [[mailto:ath10k@lists.infradead.org|ath10k@lists.infradead.org]] 
      * Cc: [[mailto:linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org|linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org]] 

Preferably use ath.git master branch as the baseline for patches. Other trees can be used as well, but then the chances of conflicts are higher. 

More info about submitting patches: 
        * [[en/developers/Documentation/SubmittingPatches|en/developers/Documentation/SubmittingPatches]] 
        * [[en/developers/Documentation/git-guide|en/developers/Documentation/git-guide]]

             * If a problem has been found during code review and doesn't fix a known issues, mention that in the commit log.

          *   If others have reported the issue commit log SHOULD use Reported-by: and Tested-by: tags.

The terminology is from [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt|http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt]] 

The ath10k patch flow is this: 
          * Patch gets posted to the mailing lists. 
          * Kalle immediately applies the patch to pending branch for build testing. 
          * Kalle waits two business days for patch being under review (unless the patch is urgent). 
          * If no comments or warnings, Kalle applies the patch to ath-next branch and sends a "Thanks, applied" reply. 
          * Kalle merges ath-next to master branch immeadiately after the patch is applies. 
          * Kalle merges ath-next into wireless-drivers-next roughly every 2-3 weeks 
          * David Miller merges wireless-drivers-next into net-next every two weeks or so 
          * Linus Torvalds merges net-next into linux.git during [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/development-process/2.Process|merge window]]
