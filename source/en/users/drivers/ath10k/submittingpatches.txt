===== Submitting patches =====

Send patches to the mailing lists below. Kalle Valo reviews the patches within the next few days and, if they are ok, commits them to ath.git. 
      * To: [[ath10k@lists.infradead.org]] 
      * Cc: [[linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org]] 

Preferably use [[en/users/drivers/ath10k/sources|ath.git master branch]] as the baseline for patches. Other trees can be used as well, but then the chances of conflicts are higher. 

More info about submitting patches: 
        * [[en/developers/Documentation/SubmittingPatches|linux-wireless submitting patches instructions]] 
        * [[en/developers/Documentation/git-guide|linux-wireless git guide]] 

==== Guidelines ====

Guidelines for patches are:
 
          * MUST follow [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html|Documentation/SubmittingPatches]]
          * MUST be compiler warning free. 
          * MUST be sparse warning free. 
          * Commit log MUST not be empty. 
          * The commit log MUST answer the question "Why?": 
             * Describe the motivation behind the bug. 
             * How does it change the functionality from user's point of view? 
             * Does it fix a bug? If it does, please describe the bug (doesn't need to be long). Also if there's a public bug report add a link to the bug report. 
             * If a problem has been found during code review and doesn't fix a known issues, mention that in the commit log.
             * Ingo Molnar has written [[https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20150314075357.GA8319@gmail.com|a nice description]] about what maintainers are looking from a commit log. 
          *   If others have reported the issue commit log SHOULD use Reported-by: and Tested-by: tags. 
          * SHOULD be //mostly// checkpatch clean (though not all patchworks warnings make sense): 
            * Patches SHOULD be sent with git send-email tool. 
            * Patchsets SHOULD contain no more than 12 patches. 
            * Patches SHOULD follow [[en/users/Drivers/ath10k/CodingStyle|ath10k coding style]] 
            * It's RECOMMENDED to test patches with [[en/users/Drivers/ath10k/CodingStyle#checking_code|ath10k-check]] 

The terminology is from [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt|http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt]] 

==== Patch flow ====

The ath10k patch flow is this: 
          * Patch gets posted to the mailing lists. 
          * Kalle immediately applies the patch to pending and master-pending branches for build testing. 
          * Kalle waits two business days for patch being under review (unless the patch is urgent). 
          * If no comments or warnings, Kalle applies the patch to ath-next branch and sends a "Thanks, applied" reply. 
          * Kalle merges ath-next to master branch immeadiately after the patch is applies. 
          * Kalle merges ath-next into wireless-drivers-next roughly every 2-3 weeks 
          * David Miller merges wireless-drivers-next into net-next every two weeks or so 
          * Linus Torvalds merges net-next into linux.git during [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/development-process/2.Process|merge window]] 

As a rough estimate it takes 2-4 months for a patch to propagate from ath.git to an official Linux release.
