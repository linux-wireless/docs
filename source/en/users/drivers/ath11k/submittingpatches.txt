===== Submitting patches =====

Send patches to the mailing lists below. Kalle Valo reviews the patches within the next few days and, if they are ok, commits them to ath.git.
 
      * To: [[ath11k@lists.infradead.org]] 
      * Cc: [[linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org]] 

Preferably use [[en/users/drivers/ath10k/sources|ath.git master branch]] as the baseline for patches. Other trees can be used as well, but then the chances of conflicts are higher.

You can follow the state of ath11k patch review from patchwork:

==== Guidelines ====

The ath11k patch guidelines are the same as [[en/users/drivers/ath10k/submittingpatches#guidelines|ath10k guidelines]].

==== Hardware families ====

ath11k supports two hardware families:

  * IPQ8074 SoC AP devices
  * QCA6390 PCI mobile devices

Just like with ath10k, all ath11k patches need to account all supported hardware families.

Few Tested-on tag examples:

<code>
Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-00410-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-2
Tested-on: IPQ6018 hw1.0 WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-01161-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
Tested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 WLAN.HST.1.0.1-01230-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1
</code>
