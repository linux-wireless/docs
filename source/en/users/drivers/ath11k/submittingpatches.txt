===== Submitting patches =====

Send patches to the mailing lists below. Kalle Valo reviews the patches within the next few days and, if they are ok, commits them to ath.git.
 
      * To: [[ath11k@lists.infradead.org]] 
      * Cc: [[linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org]] 

Preferably use [[en/users/drivers/ath10k/sources|ath.git master branch]] as the baseline for patches. Other trees can be used as well, but then the chances of conflicts are higher.

You can follow the state of ath11k patch review from patchwork:

==== Guidelines ====

Guidelines for patches are:
 
  * MUST follow [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html|Documentation/SubmittingPatches]]
  * MUST follow [[en/users/Drivers/ath10k/CodingStyle|ath10k coding style]]
  * MUST be compiler and sparse warning free. 
  * [[https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-send-email.html|git send-email]] SHOULD be used to submit the patch to avoid any formatting issues.
  * Patchsets SHOULD contain no more than 12 patches and include a cover letter. 
  * Commit log MUST answer the question "Why?": 
    * Describe the motivation behind the bug. 
    * How does it change the functionality from user's point of view? 
    * Does it fix a bug? If it does, please describe the bug (doesn't necessarily need to be long). Also if there's a public bug report add a link to the bug report or email describing the issue. 
    * If a problem has been found during code review and doesn't fix a known issue, mention that in the commit log this is a theoretical fix.
    * This also implies that the commit log MUST not be empty. 
    * Ingo Molnar has written [[https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20150314075357.GA8319@gmail.com|a nice description]] about what maintainers are looking from a commit log.
  * Commit log MUST document the affected hardware versions, bus type and firmware version(s) tested
  * SHOULD use [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#using-reported-by-tested-by-reviewed-by-suggested-by-and-fixes|Reported-by: and Tested-by: tags]] if others have reported the issue.
  * SHOULD use [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-changes|Fixes: tag]] if it fixes a regression caused by known commit.
  * SHOULD be //mostly// checkpatch clean (though not all patchworks warnings make sense), it's RECOMMENDED to test patches with [[en/users/Drivers/ath10k/CodingStyle#checking_code|ath11k-check]] as that will disable the useless warnings.

The terminology is from [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt|http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt]]
