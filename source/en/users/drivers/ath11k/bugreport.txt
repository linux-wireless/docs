===== Reporting ath11k bugs =====

ath11k bug reports can be filed to [[https://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Drivers|bugzilla.kernel.org]]. Use these catagories:

  * Product: Drivers
  * Component: network-wireless
  * Summary: start with string "ath11k:"

To make it easier for the developers to help the bug report include at least this version:

  * Exact kernel version. Is it a distro kernel or have you compiled it yourself? Any extra patches?
  * Host device information, for example if it's a laptop make and model, architecture, CPU etc.
  * BIOS version.
  * Output from: uname -a
  * Output from: lpsci -mnn
  * Output from: find /lib/firmware/ath11k/ -type f | xargs md5sum
  * Output from: dmesg | grep ath11k

Bugzilla is not actively followed by all developers, so it's a good idea to also send a short mail to [[en/users/Drivers/ath11k/mailinglist|the mailing list]]. Usually a post to the mailing list gathers more attention. Also questions should be sent to the mailing list.

Patches are not submitted via bugzilla, see [[en/users/Drivers/ath11k/submittingpatches|Submitting patches]].
