===== Reporting ath11k bugs =====

ath11k bug reports can be filed to [[https://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Drivers|bugzilla.kernel.org]]. Use these catagories:

  * Product: Drivers
  * Component: network-wireless
  * Summary: start with string "ath11k:"

To make it easier for the developers to help, include in the bug report at least this information:

  * Exact kernel version. Is it a distro kernel or have you compiled it yourself? Any extra patches?
  * Host device information, for example if it's a laptop make and model, architecture, CPU etc.
  * BIOS version.
  * Output from: uname -a
  * Output from: lspci -mnn
  * Output from: find /lib/firmware/ath11k/ -type f | xargs md5sum
  * Output from: dmesg | grep ath11k

As distros (Ubuntu, Fedora etc) can modify ath11k on their own, and it's difficult to track what has changed, it's best to report bugs with distro kernels to the distro bug trackers. https://bugzilla.kernel.org should be used only for bugs found with upstream releases download from https://www.kernel.org.

Bugzilla is not actively followed by all developers, so it's a good idea to also send a short mail to [[en/users/Drivers/ath11k/mailinglist|the mailing list]]. Usually a post to the mailing list gathers more attention. Also questions and support requests should be sent to the mailing list, not to bugzilla. Bugzilla is not used as a support forum, it is just to collect actual bugs.

Patches are not submitted via bugzilla, see [[en/users/Drivers/ath11k/submittingpatches|Submitting patches]].
