==== Driver ====

ath11k is included in official Linux releases starting from v5.6, just download the latest release from https://www.kernel.org/ or use a recent enough Linux distribution. Ensure below options are selected in the kernel (debug, tracing and spectral scan options are optional):

<code>
make menuconfig
--> Select Device drivers
        --> Network device support
                --> Wireless LAN
                        --> Enable as below
                                <M> Qualcomm Technologies 11ax chipset support
                                <M>       Atheros ath11k PCI support
                                [*]       QCA ath11k debugging
                                [*]       QCA ath11k debugfs support
                                [*]       ath11k tracing support
                                [*]     QCA ath11k spectral scan support
</code>
                        
Build and install the kernel and the kernel modules. There are multiple ways to do that depending on your preferences and the Linux distribution you are using, check the documentation for your distro how you want to do it. Few pointers:

  * https://wiki.debian.org/BuildADebianKernelPackage
  * https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel
  * https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Building_a_custom_kernel

The ath11k firmware images are available from [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/|linux-firmware.git]] which all common Linux distributions should install by default. Latest firmware images can be downloaded from [[https://git.codelinaro.org/clo/ath-firmware/ath11k-firmware|ath11k-firmware.git]] from which they get eventually pushed to [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/|linux-firmware.git]].
