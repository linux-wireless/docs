===== ar6k =====

ar6k is the GPL driver for the Atheros AR6000 mobile 802.11bg chipset used on the [[OpenMoko|OpenMoko]]. 

 


===== Getting the code =====

ar6k never made it upstream but openmoko maintains the driver on their git repository. You can get the latest ar6k code from a branch on their repository: 


<code>git clone git://git.openmoko.org/git/kernel.git openmoko
cd openmkoko
git checkout -b ar6k origin/andy-tracking</code>

===== Code on openmoko git =====

You can find the ar6k code under: 


<code>drivers/ar6000/</code>

===== Sharing code upstream =====

It may be possible to share HTC/HIF/WMI code with the [[en/users/Drivers/ar9271|ar9271]] USB driver. This needs further review.
