**ath6kl todo** 

 


===== Cleanup items =====

High priority: 
  * cleanup locking 
  *  * review all locking 
  *  * document what each lock is supposed to protect 
  *  * try to reduce the number of locks, semaphores and mutexes 
  *  * convert semaphores to mutexes 
  *  * the DMA bounce buffer should probably be protected by a lock so dueling threads don't corrupt it 
  *   use ath6kl prefix everywhere 
  *   high coupling between main.c and init.c 
  *   confusion with header files 
  *    * function prototypes not in corresponding .h files 
  *    * no core.h 
  *    * no init.h 
  *    * no main.h 
  *    * no txrx.h 
  *     merge structs 
  *      * merge struct htc_target to struct ath6kl 
  *      * merge struct ath6kl_device to struct ath6kl 
  *      * merge struct aggr_info to struct ath6kl 
  *      * merge struct wmi to struct ath6kl 
  *       replace all void pointers with proper types 
  *        * for example, use property or unions 
  *        * if not possible for some reason, then document properly what types void pointer might contain 
  *        *  * (There are about three void pointers in htc.h, this would result in significant amount of cleanup) 
  *        *  remove nl80211_tx_power_setting comment 
  *        *  ath6kl_cfg80211_change_iface() needs to change mode before function returns 
  *        *  useless memset(ar->ssid, 0, sizeof(ar->ssid)) 
  *        *  ath6kl_cfg80211_get_key() should not call the callback in the -ENOENT case 
  *        *  remove ieee80211com from a comment 
  *        *  ath6kl_priv() should return a proper type 
  *        *  scat_list should be scat_list[ ATH6KL_SCATTER_ENTRIES_PER_REQ] rather than scat_list[1] 
  *        *  memcpy mess in htc_setup_tx_complete() 
  *        *  ath6kl_cleanup_amsdu_rxbufs is racy 
  *        *   * can't drop lock with list_for_each macros 
  *        *    list_empty() in ath6kl_alloc_amsdu_rxbuf() is useless 
  *        *     * you can iterate an empty list 
  *        *      use ieee80211_data_to_8023() 
  *        *       * instead of ath6kl_wmi_dot11_hdr_remove() Low priority: 
  *        *        * use align macro in aggr_slice_amsdu() 
  *        *        * clean up arEvent usage 
  *        *        * clean up wmitimeout usage 
  *        *        * remove mdelay() 
  *        *        * remove casts from ar6k_priv() users 
  *        *        * cleanup wait_event apis 
  *        *        * bmi: use struct for commands, not memcpy() 
  *        *        * fix 0x%lX debug format 
  *        *        *  * use %p 
  *        *        *  * remove (unsigned long) casts 
  *        *        *  * use decimals when printing lengths 
  *        *        *   change all read/write functions' buf to a void pointer 
  *        *        *   move WARN_ON() inside if test 
  *        *        *   cleanup ath6kl_init_netdev() & co 
  *        *        *   replace ntohs() with be16_to_cpu() 
  *        *        *   rename wmip to wmi 
  *        *        *   ath6kl firmware fetch fails if it's linked to kernel (Y choise) 
  *        *        *   ATH_COMMON kconfig enables some code which is not needed by ath6kl 
  *        *        *   fix all FIXMEs 
  *        *        *   remove ath6kl_cookie (vasanth) 
  *        *        *    * needs significant code change 
  *        *        *     inspect structs for alignment and packing appropiateness 
  *        *        *      * [[http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=131053135626622&w=2|http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=131053135626622&w=2]] 
  *        *        *       switch from cfg80211_inform_bss_frame() to cfg80211_inform_bss() 
  *        *        *        * was there a reason why we actually need _frame() variant? 
  *        *        *         logic in htc_tx_from_ep_txq() is convoluted 
  *        *        *         buffer tx packets 
  *        *        *          * to improve throughput and avoid excessive stopping of queues 
  *        *        *           create separate queues for each AC 
  *        *        *            * so that they can be stopped individually 
  *        *        *             use of ar->nw_type is not consistent 
  *        *        *              * some places we test it with '==' even though '&' should be used as it's a bitfield 
  *        *        *               interface to enable tx uart with hi_serial_enable register 
  *        *        *                * maybe using debugfs? Then an item is done, please mark it with <del>strike through</del>. If you plan to work on something, please mark the item with "(nick)".
