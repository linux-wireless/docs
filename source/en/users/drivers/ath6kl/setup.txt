===== Setting up ath6kl =====


==== Kernel configuration ====

Starting from Linux kernel 3.2 ath6kl is available from kernel menuconfig: 


<code>-> Device Drivers
 -> Network device support (NETDEVICES [=y])
  -> Wireless LAN (WLAN [=y])
   -> Atheros Wireless Cards (ATH_COMMON [=y])
    -> Atheros mobile chipsets support (ATH6KL [=m])</code>
Or alternatively search for CONFIG_ATH6KL. 


==== Suspend ====

ath6kl supports various suspend which can be controlled with two module parameters, suspend_mode and wow_mode. 

suspend_mode makes it possible to force a certain mode when host suspends: 
| **value** | **mode** |
| 0 | automatic (default) |
| 1 | cutpower |
| 2 | deepsleep |
| 3 | wow |

Definion of different suspend modes: 

  ; automatic  : the suspend mode is chosen based on host hardware capabilities 
  ; cutpower  : the chip is powered off for maximum power savings and hence resume is slower 
  ; deepsleep  : the firmware is running on the chip but is kept 
  ; wow  : if ath6kl is connected to an AP device will maintain the connection with Wake-on-WLAN feature while host is suspended 
If wow mode is enabled it's possible to choose different wow submode with wow_mode parameter: 
| **value** | **mode** |
| 0 | default |
| 1 | cutpower when disconnected |
| 2 | deepsleep when disconnected |

Definion of different wow modes: 

  ; default  : Chooses the default mode from below which is subject to change. 
  ; cutpower  : 
If ath6kl is //not// connected to an AP the power is cut from the wifi chip. If connected to an AP WoW mode is used. 

  ; deepsleep  : 
If ath6kl is //not// connected to an AP the firmware is put to low power deep sleep state. If connected to an AP WoW mode is used.
