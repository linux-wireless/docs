===== ath3k =====

ath3k is the Linux Bluetooth driver for Atheros AR3011/AR3012 Bluetooth chipsets. 

 


===== Firmware =====

For AR3011, you can find the "ath3k-1.fw" on the linux-firmware.git tree: 


<code>git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git</code>
For AR3012, you can find the "AthrBT_0x01020200.dfu" and "ramps_0x01020200_26.dfu" or "ramps_0x01020200_40.dfu" on the linux-firmware git tree: 


<code>git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/ar3k/</code>

===== AR3011 over USB =====

This is supported through CONFIG_BT_ATH3K, merged upstream as of 2.6.33. If you have an older kernel you can use [[en/users/Download/stable|stable compat-wireless-2.6.33]] or later tarballs. 


==== AR3011 with SFLASH configurations ====

When AR3011 ships with SFLASH configurations upon device load the AR3011 will actually appear to the host system as a generic USB Bluetooth device and requires uploading of firmware onto the device to re-enumerate itself as an AR3011 device. You need to add the VID/PID of your device in both the btusb.c blacklist and the ath3k.c support list. You can refer to an example [[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=commit;h=e9036e336a8e5640871e0006ea4a89982b25046f|here]] 


===== AR3012 over USB =====

This is supported through CONFIG_BT_ATH3K, merged upstream as of 3.0.9. Like AR3011 with SFLASH configuration, you need to add the VID/PID of your device in both the btusb.c blacklist and the ath3k.c support list to load AR3012 firmware. You can refer to what it's done for 0x0cf3/0x3004 one. 


===== How to tell AR3011 and AR3012 =====

You can use lsusb -v to check the device descriptor. If it's AR3011, the iProduct value is 0. If it's AR3012 the iProduct value is 2. 


===== AR3001/AR3002 over UART =====

This is supported through CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_ATH3K, merged upstream as of 2.6.36 and BlueZ 4.77. You can find AR3001/AR3002 firmware on the linux-firmware git tree: 


<code>git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/ar3k/</code>
