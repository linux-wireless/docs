===== Submitting patches =====

Send patches to the mailing lists below. Kalle Valo reviews the patches within the next few days and, if they are ok, commits them to ath.git.
 
      * To: [[ath12k@lists.infradead.org]] 
      * Cc: [[linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org]] 

Preferably use [[en/users/drivers/ath10k/sources|ath.git main branch]] as the baseline for patches. Other trees can be used as well, but then the chances of conflicts are higher.

You can follow the state of ath12k patch review from patchwork:

==== Guidelines ====

The ath12k patch guidelines are the same as [[en/users/drivers/ath10k/submittingpatches#guidelines|ath10k guidelines]].

==== Hardware families ====

ath12k supports two hardware families:

  * QCN9274 PCI AP devices
  * WCN7850 PCI mobile devices

Just like with ath10k, all ath12k patches need to account all supported hardware families.

==== Tested-on tag ====

Testing information needs to be provided using Tested-on tag. Few Tested-on tag examples:

<code>
Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0-03427-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-1.15378.4
</code>

The ath12k patch flow is the same as [[en/users/drivers/ath10k/submittingpatches#patch_flow|ath10k patch flow]]
