===== Installing ath12k =====

As of this writing (August 2023) Linux distributions do not support ath12k devices out of box, so you need to install kernel and firmware manually. Here are simple instructions how to install Linux kernel v6.4 with ath12k PCI support and latest ath12k firmwares.

Clone kernel:
<code>
  git clone -b v6.4 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
</code>

Ensure below options are selected in the kernel (debugging and tracing support are optional):

<code>
cd linux
make menuconfig
--> Select Device drivers
        --> Network device support
                --> Wireless LAN
                        --> Enable as below
                                <M> Qualcomm Technologies Wi-Fi 7 support (ath12k)
                                <M>       Atheros ath12k PCI support
                                [*]       ath12k debugging
                                [*]       ath12k tracing support
</code>

Build and install the kernel and the kernel modules. There are multiple ways to do that depending on your preferences and the Linux distribution you are using, check the documentation for your distro how you want to do it. Few pointers:

  * https://wiki.debian.org/BuildADebianKernelPackage
  * https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel
  * https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Building_a_custom_kernel

Clone ath11k firmware project which currently also contains the ath12k firmware:
<code>
  git clone https://github.com/kvalo/ath11k-firmware.git
</code>

Install ath12k Wi-fi firmware:
<code>
  sudo mkdir -p /lib/firmware/ath12k
  cd ath11k-firmware/ath12k-testing
  sudo cp -r * /lib/firmware/ath12k/
</code>
