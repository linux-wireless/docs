====== Introduction ======

Intel works with periodic releases of the iwlwifi drivers that are tested with a specific combination of components. They are called LinuxCore releases and are numbered sequentially, e.g. LinuxCore11 is the latest stable release as of May 2015.
These releases can be seen as snapshots of the development trees (including upstream) that are tested thoroughly together with a specific version of the firmware and userspace components (i.e. wpa_supplicant and hostapd).

==== Components ====
The components used in each release are specific stabilization versions of the following:
  * iwlwifi driver
  * mac80211
  * cfg80211
  * backport
  * firmware
  * hostap

====== Who are you? ======

==== If you use a well known distribution ====
If you use a well maintained distribution, your device should be supported out of the box. If your device doesn't work at all (you can't even see it in the interface list), then it might mean that your kernel is too old or that you don't have the proper firmware. You can contact your distribution to have them fix this. In the meantime, you can use the backport tree to make your device work. Make sure to install the proper firmware as well. If your device works minimally (you can see it in the interface list), but you experience issues, please check the support section. You can also use the backport tree to check if the issue you are suffering from has been fixed in different releases. The backport tree is also an excellent tool to bisect regressions. Note that when you install the backport drivers, you disallow the usage of any WLAN device that is not supported by iwlmvm. To check if your device is supported by iwlmvm, please check [[en:users:drivers:iwlwifi#Firmware|here]] in the module column.

====If you are building your own system====
If you are building your own system and you know that the only WLAN device you'll have is from Intel, the backport tree is what you need. You'll be able to get a driver / firmware combo that has been validated together. As a rule of thumb, you should take the latest Core version available.

====A note about upstream policy====
The fact that Intel published a backport tree for its WLAN drivers doesn't impact its commitment to upstream all the code to the mainline kernel. It simply allows users who can't choose their kernel to work with a more recent driver. The backport tree allows us to provide a combo of the driver / firmware that has been fully validated. For a simple reason of capacity, we cannot test as thoroughly all the kernel versions / firmwares / devices matrix. There is code in the backport tree that is not in the mainline kernel, but this is transient. Eventually, all the code in the backport tree will reach mainline unless it has dependencies (platform drivers etc...).

====== Core release ======
A Core release includes all the components described [[en:users:drivers:iwlwifi:core_release#Components|above]]. Here is the way to match all these components together.
backport, iwlwifi, mac80211 and cfg80211 come from the [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/iwlwifi/backport-iwlwifi.git/|backport-iwlwifi git repository]]. You'll find the relevant Core branches there (release/LinuxCoreX). For all the Core releases, the version 2.4 or later of [[https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/|hostap]] should be taken.
The firmware can be found in [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/iwlwifi/linux-firmware.git/|iwlwifi's linux-firmware clone]].
Here is the table to map the firmware version to Core:

====== Support ======
The support model for Core releases is the same as for the mainline kernel described in the [[en:users:drivers:iwlwifi#Support|support section]]. We will be happy to assist for any pure WLAN bug, but please take into account that platform integration isn't trivial: it can cause random issues. We also don't commit to work on all the platforms.
