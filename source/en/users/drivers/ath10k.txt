[1] The Compex WLE900VX card enumerates as PCI device on some PCs but not for some other PCs. The reason could possibly be PC hardware or kernel version. Detailed info: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84821. The Chaos Calmer wpj344a_150827_vCC.img provided by http://www.compex.com.sg/downloads/ can detect and enable the WLE900VX card with ath10k.

===== Not supported =====

ath10k does NOT support older QCA98xx hw1.0 chips found, for example, from these devices:

  * QCA9880 Version 1 found in [[http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500|TP-Link WDR-7500 v2 and Archer C7 v1.x]]

Any SDIO or USB devices are not supported, but work is ongoing to add that.

===== Known bugs/limitations =====

  * firmware does not support association to the same AP from different virtual STA interfaces (driver prints "ath10k: Failed to add peer XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX for VDEV: X" in that case)
  * packet injection isn't supported yet
  * applying ath9k regulatory domain hack patch from OpenWRT causes firmware crash (reason: regulatory hint function is never called and ath10k never sends scan channel list to the firmware which in turn causes firmware to crash on scan)
  * tx rate is reported as 6mbps due to firmware limitation (no tx rate information in tx completions); instead see /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/ath10k/fw_stats
  * WEP doesn't work with AP_VLANs - frames are sent unencrypted (observed on: 999.999.0.636, 10.2.4.20-1, 10.1.467.2-1)
  * TX speeds are extremely poor on certain chips (QCA6174 is one). A [[https://gist.github.com/harrykipper/d1bedb234c4af0692f7ccd33329a02d7|patch]] solves the issue in most cases ([[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1689990#p1689990|source]])
