===== About ath10k =====

ath10k is the mac80211 wireless driver for Qualcom Atheros QCA988x family of chips, which support [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE|IEEE 802.11ac]].

A major difference from [[ath9k]] is that there's now a firmware and that's why we had to implement a new driver.

The ath10k driver is located under drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k directory. To easily browse the sources you can access that through [[https://github.com/kvalo/ath/tree/master/drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k|github source listing]].

===== IRC channel =====

For real time discussions there is #ath10k channel on Freenode.

===== Known bugs/limitations =====

  * firmware does not support association to the same AP from different virtual STA interfaces (driver prints "ath10k: Failed to add peer XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX for VDEV: X" in that case)
  * packet injection isn't supported yet
  * applying ath9k regulatory domain hack patch from OpenWRT causes firmware crash (reason: regulatory hint function is never called and ath10k never sends scan channel list to the firmware which in turn causes firmware to crash on scan)
  * tx rate is reported as 6mbps due to firmware limitation (no tx rate information in tx completions); instead see /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phyX/ath10k/fw_stats
  * WEP doesn't work with AP_VLANs - frames are sent unencrypted (observed on: 999.999.0.636, 10.2.4.20-1, 10.1.467.2-1)

[1] The Compex WLE900VX card enumerates as PCI device on some PCs but not for some other PCs. The reason could possibly be PC hardware or kernel version. Detailed info: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84821. The Chaos Calmer wpj344a_150827_vCC.img provided by http://www.compex.com.sg/downloads/ can detect and enable the WLE900VX card with ath10k.

ath10k does NOT support older QCA98xx hw1.0 chips found, for example, from these devices:

  * QCA9880 Version 1 found in [[http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500|TP-Link WDR-7500 v2 and Archer C7 v1.x]]
