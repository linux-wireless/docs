===== About Ath5k =====

Ath5k is a completely FOSS wireless driver for Atheros based wireless chipset versions AR5xxx in the Linux Kernel. It has evolved out of [[http://madwifi-project.org/|MadWiFi]], [[https://madwifi-project.org/wiki/About/OpenHAL|OpenHAL]], and the [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mcgrof/legacy-hal.tar.bz2|open-sourced HAL]] code of Atheros and [[http://svn.freebsd.org/base/projects/ath_hal/|Sam Leffler]]. 

 


===== News =====


==== 2010-12-03 ====

**AHB Bus support**: Support for the AHB bus got merged. Now ath5k can be used on AR231X and AR5312 embedded devices (WiSoC). ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commit;h=a0b907ee2a71052fefdf6151764095f3f97b3275|commit]]) 


==== 2010-11-30 ====

**Preparations for Turbo Mode and half/quarter rate support:** Big internal update of PHY code to clean up turbo modes and reset and add half/quarter rate support (50/10MHz channel widths). These new modes are not enabled yet, and it's unlikely that there will be a standard API for enabling them in the near future, however developers/researchers can use them for various projects like 802.11p support. ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commit;h=9320b5c4a7260d9593102f378201d17e3f030739|first commit]]) 

**Synthesizer-only channel change for newer chips:** On AR2413/AR5413 we now support faster channel switching by skipping normal reset and directly setting the channel on PHY while it's still active ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commitdiff;h=8aec7af99b1e4594c4bb9e1c48005e6111f97e8e|commit]]). 


==== 2010-10-05 ====

**Support for virtual STA and AP added:** Support for up to 4 virtual APs and as many virtual STA interfaces as desired got added ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commit;h=b1ae1edf9e9872d3aa657cc34ae40c9aadfbc72f|commit]]). This feature is sometimes also called "Multi ESSID" and allows us to configure several AP and STA interfaces on top of only one physical device. 


==== 2010-09-28 ====

**802.11e/WME/QoS support:** Support for QoS/WME, using multiple hardware queues, got merged. ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commit;h=925e0b061300c94912be36eac16f0b44249a1add|commit]]) 


==== 2010-09-16 ====

**Hardware Encryption:** Hardware encryption is enabled again, by sharing code with ath9k. Before that HW encryption was disabled in AP mode due to bugs in the ath5k key handling. ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commit;h=e0f8c2a9b879e1e65d588a40a3c88db69a7d6956|commit]]) 


==== 2010-08-13 ====

**Disable ASPM L0s for all cards**: This fixes problems with PCI-E cards, especially on Acer Aspire One. ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commit;h=6ccf15a1a76d2ff915cdef6ae4d12d0170087118|commit]]) 


==== 2010-04-07 ====

**ANI implementation added:** Adaptive Noise Immunity (ANI) got implemented. This greatly improves performance in noisy environments. ([[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-testing.git;a=commit;h=2111ac0d888767999c7dd6d1309dcc1fb8012022|commit]]) 


===== Mailing list =====

[[en/developers/mailinglists|linux-wireless]] is the recommended mailing list to use.

The archives â€‹for the old ath5k-devel list, which was closed in 2017, are available [[https://lists.ath5k.org/mailman/listinfo/ath5k-devel|here]].


===== Getting ath5k =====

The driver is pre-installed in most current Linux distributions. ath5k is available through different places: 
  * The [[en/developers/process|wireless-testing]] tree - this is where the latest code can be found and what the develpers work with. 
  * The [[en/users/Download|Linux wireless compatibility package]] - the most easy way to get and install the latest versions on all stable kernels. 
  * The Linux kernel from version **2.6.25** and up. However, we recommend to use at least **2.6.31**. 
  * The Linux kernel **2.6.38** has some bugs in ath5k. We recommend to install the [[en/users/Download|Linux wireless compatibility package]] if you are running this kernel and your internet connection is slow or unreliable. 
  * [[en/users/Drivers/ath9k/RHEL5|ath5k on RHEL5]] 


==== Enabling ath5k ====

To enable ath5k in the kernel configuration, you must first enable mac80211: 
<code>Networking support --->
  Wireless  --->
    <M>   cfg80211 - wireless configuration API
    <M>   Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (mac80211)</code>
Please note that in older kernels there was another 802.11 networking stack: 
<code>    < > Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack</code>
You do not need this. This option enables the old SoftMAC which is already removed from newer kernels. You can still safely enable this though. 

You can then enable ath5k in the kernel configuration under 
<code>Device Drivers  --->
  [*] Network device support  --->
        Wireless LAN  --->
          <M>   Atheros Wireless Cards  ---> 
            <M>   Atheros 5xxx wireless cards support</code>
To try the driver you can do something like this: 
<code>modprobe ath5k
sudo ip link set wlan%d up
sudo iwconfig wlan%d essid any
# Make sure you get auth'd and then assoc'd
# Then either set an IP manually or get it via DHCP
ping gw</code>

===== Supported Devices =====

See the [[en/users/Drivers/ath5k/devices|ath5k device list]]. This list is still very much incomplete - please add your device/card if it works! A longer but less reliable list can be found at [[http://madwifi-project.org/wiki/Compatibility|http://madwifi-project.org/wiki/Compatibility]]. It's worth trying your card with ath5k even though it is not in the list above, if it has one of the following chips:

==== Supported PCI IDs ====

Currently supported PCI ID list with respective status report on basic-testing as defined above. 
<code>Vendor:device   Type    Name     Basic-testing

168c:001d       <<      AR2417   OK</code>

==== Notes on supported devices ====

"OK" means that card operates as good as with binary drivers. 

"Should work" means that card hasn't been tested (we haven't received any reports) but since chipset is the same with a tested, working card, it should work as well. 

(*) 001c is used also for AR2425 parts. 


===== Features =====

Supports 802.11abg, depending on the chipset. This driver requires no firmware or binary-only HAL!

**Please** when submitting a bug report **always** include your card's silicon revision for MAC and PHY chips, just look at your kernel log for a line like this one... or <code>dmesg |grep "ath5.*chip"</code>: 


<code>ath5k phy0: Atheros AR2413 chip found (MAC: 0x78, PHY: 0x45)</code>
...and put it in your report. <code>lspci</code> information is much less useful than this. 


===== ath5k TODO List =====

Things ath5k developers are currently working on, and other things to do: 
        *             * Tx power support (setting tx power) (Nick/Felix -works but experiments show that the card transmits only on some standard power levels instead of a power range as expected -still debuging, any ideas are welcome) 
        *             * Power saving (Bob) 
        *             * AR5210 support (EEPROM etc) (Nick) 
        *             * EAR (EEPROM Added Registers) support 
        *             * Documentation update/cleanup (Nick - added kerneldoc on all hw related functions and files, need to do some more reading) 
        *             * Radar detection/DFS stuff 
        *             * Update ath_info
