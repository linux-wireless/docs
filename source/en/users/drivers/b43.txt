**b43** and **b43legacy** are wireless drivers for Broadcom [[en/developers/Documentation/Glossary#softmac|SoftMAC]] chipsets. Kernel will automatically pick a proper module for you:
 * **b43** for any new (supported) hardware
 * **b43legacy** for BCM4301 and early BCM4306 versions

===== Summary =====

 * You need to have firmware files (usually in /lib/firmware/) so ''b43(legacy)'' can upload them to the card and run properly.

===== List of hardware =====

To check for a present hardware model execute following command:
<code>lspci -nn -d 14e4:</code>
Please look carefully at device ID and chipset name.
