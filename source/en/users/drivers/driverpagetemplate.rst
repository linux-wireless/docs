   Please delete these paragraphs and follow the editing instructions
   below, deleting them while going through.

caveats

Anything worth knowing up front? If not, delete this section. Examples
could be "this usb device uses a lot of power" or such.

If you distinguish between chips and devices (because, for example, the
chips are produced by company X and used by dozens of OEMS) then put
chip info here, otherwise delete the section.

available devices
-----------------

Link to a device list, or preferably put it on a subpage `/devices
<en/users/Drivers/DriverPageTemplate/devices>`__ like

the global list.
