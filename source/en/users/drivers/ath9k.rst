Enabling ath9k
--------------

To enable ath9k, you must first enable mac80211 through *make menuconfig* when compiling your kernel. If you do not know what this means then please learn to compile kernels or rely on your Linux distribution's kernel. Below are the options you need to enable ath9k through *make menuconfig*.
