===== mac80211 issues =====

This page lists the issues blocking zd1211rw moving to the mac80211 stack. Some of these may already be resolved, they just need to be checked. 


==== TX disabling ====

In the softmac driver, we temporarily disable TX while updating preamble mode and basic rates. This is not possible to do in mac80211 at the moment. 


==== Basic rates handling ====

In the softmac driver, we program the basic rates for RTS/CTS based on the association info. Need a similar system in mac80211. 


==== Detailed error statistics ====

Ulrich has greatly improved the zd1211rw 802.11 error statistics. This code needs moving over to the mac80211 driver after figuring out how mac80211 does this.

==== Testing on ARM and SPARC64 ====

We have happy ARM and SPARC64 users. To my knowledge, mac80211 has not been tested there. 
    * However, we do test on powerpc and x86 so there's unlikely to be problems. Also, who's going to test mac80211 without a driver? IMHO this is a requirement that can't be solved. -- [[JohannesBerg|JohannesBerg]]
