ZD1211 hardware encryption/decryption
=====================================

ZD1211 implements a CAM (Content Addressable Memory) interface for
encryption and decryption in hardware. Actually, the implementation is
not quite a CAM, it is more of a specialised search engine.

Many thanks to ZyDAS for providing some basic documentation about this
component and allowing us to publish it.
