You can send question to the [[en/developers/MailingLists|Linux wireless mailing list]]. Again, unless you're familiar with the mailing list, it makes sense to read [[http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html|How To Ask Questions The Smart Way]] before you post. 


===== Reporting bugs =====

If you have a bug please read our [[en/users/Documentation/Reporting_bugs|Reporting bugs guideline]].
