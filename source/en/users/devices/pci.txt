===== PCI and PCI-Express cards =====

//Note: this list is still incomplete as not all drivers have information// 


==== Form factors ====

There are various form factors for PCI/PCI-E cards: 

  ; Cardbus  : 
also called **PC Card**, this is a form factor similiar to PCMCIA. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Card|Wikipedia has an image]]. 

  ; PCI  : 
A regular PCI card, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI#Conventional_hardware_specifications|again you can find an image on Wikipedia]]. 

  ; Mini-PCI  : A card typically used in laptops until maybe 2007 or so. 
  ; PCI Express  : pretty much the successor to PCI, actually having a completely different bus architecture. 
  ; Mini-PCI-E  : 
mini-PCI express, the PCI Express equivalent of Mini-PCI, but even smaller. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#PCI_Express_Mini_Card|Wikipedia has an image of this too]]. 

  ; ExpressCard  : 
The hot-pluggable version of PCI Express. Note that Express<code></code>Cards can be USB as well, in which case they won't be listed here.
