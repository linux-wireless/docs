Form factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are various form factors for PCI/PCI-E cards:

::

   ; Cardbus  :

also called **PC Card**, this is a form factor similiar to PCMCIA. `Wikipedia has an image <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Card>`__.

::

   ; PCI  : 

A regular PCI card, `again you can find an image on Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI#Conventional_hardware_specifications>`__.

::

   ; Mini-PCI  : A card typically used in laptops until maybe 2007 or so. 
   ; PCI Express  : pretty much the successor to PCI, actually having a completely different bus architecture. 
   ; Mini-PCI-E  : 

mini-PCI express, the PCI Express equivalent of Mini-PCI, but even smaller. `Wikipedia has an image of this too <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#PCI_Express_Mini_Card>`__.

::

   ; ExpressCard  : 

The hot-pluggable version of PCI Express. Note that ExpressCards can be USB as well, in which case they won't be listed here.
