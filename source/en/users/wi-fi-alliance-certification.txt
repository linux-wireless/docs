==== Hardware ====
  * End product: ARMv5, Atmel SAM9G25 based GARDENA smart gateway ([[https://github.com/husqvarnagroup/smart-garden-gateway-public|sources]])
  * For development: x86_amd64, [[https://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/de/wireless_adapters_n150/ew-7811un/|Edimax EW-7811UN]]

Progress: Hardware is already on the market, nothing left to do or could be changed for that matter.

==== Firmware ====
As of 2020-08-31, linux-firmware contains firmware version 80.0, which is known to hang on the GARDENA smart gateway as long-term tests have shown (and on other machines too - Google knows). Only a cold reset resolves the problem, which is easy to do for an USB WLAN stick but very problematic (human intervention needed) on a embedded device without hardware reset capabilities for the USB device.

Therefore, all driver development and the verification is getting done with firmware version 88.2, **which is not yet mainlined as of 2020-08-31**, but has the mentioned problem resolved.
