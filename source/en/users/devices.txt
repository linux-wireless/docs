===== Supported devices =====

We try to maintain lists of supported hardware for each driver, so there's no combined information here.

TODO: add a list of driver device pages here? We no longer have a macro to collect it all into one big list as we used to have.

===== Looking for ... =====

Are you looking for a specific device with specific capabilities? Unfortunately we don't have all information easily accessible yet, but if you're, for instance, looking for a card supporting AP mode, head over to the [[en/users/Drivers|Drivers]] page, look at drivers that support AP mode, and then filter on those drivers on these device pages.
