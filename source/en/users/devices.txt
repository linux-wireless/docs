===== Supported devices =====

We try to maintain lists of supported hardware for each driver, and here collect them regardless of drivers: 
  * [[en/users/Devices/PCI|PCI devices (that includes Cardbus, Mini-PCI and PCI Express)]] 
  * [[en/users/Devices/USB|USB devices]] 
  * [[en/users/Devices/PCMCIA|PCMCIA (not Cardbus) devices]] 

Unfortunately not all drivers have their information on this site so all three lists are incomplete. 


===== Looking for ... =====

Are you looking for a specific device with specific capabilities? Unfortunately we don't have all information easily accessible yet, but if you're, for instance, looking for a card supporting AP mode, head over to the [[en/users/Drivers|Drivers]] page, look at drivers that support AP mode, and then filter on those drivers on these device pages.
