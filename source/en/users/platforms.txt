===== Wireless router platforms =====

A lot of wireless access points ship on specific custom vendor platforms. This is done to simplify the units and communication. These are also known as [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System-on-a-chip|System on Chip (SoC)]] solutions. 


==== Atheros ====

The following platforms are being worked on by the [[http://openwrt.org|OpenWrt]] development project and the current platform codes are available in the [[https://dev.openwrt.org|OpenWrt SVN repository]] until they mature enough for upstream inclusion. 


=== AR231x/5312 ===

Work on supporting ath5k on these devices will start soon. 


=== AR913x ===

Patches have been [[http://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=123099030513681|submitted to add support to ath9k on the AR9130/AR9132 platforms]]. These patches are under review now for inclusion.
