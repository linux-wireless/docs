===== Free Linux Wireless Driver Development! =====

If you are a wireless vendor and would like to see a driver for your hardware in Linux we have good news for you. We will write the driver for you for free! In addition we will also commit to keep testing it through the different kernel versions and support it for you through our community effort. Please note that we are prepared to deal with NDAs. We have arranged a program with the [[http://www.linux-foundation.org|Linux-Foundation]] to work with NDAs for drivers. NDAs are usually signed either to keep information about the device private until it is announced at a specific date, or to just keep the actual specification documents from being released to the public directly. All code created by this NDA program is to be released under the GPL for inclusion in the main kernel tree, nothing will be obfuscated at all. 

If you would like us to write a driver for you please [[http://linuxdriverproject.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/CompanyProcess|review the CompanyProcess]] at [[http://linuxdriverproject.org/|linuxdriverproject.org]] effort.
